        <h1>Top 5 Movies of All Time</h1>
        <p>Here are my top 5 movies of all time, each with a description of why they made the list and what makes them special:</p>
        
        <section id="movie1">
            <h2>1. Godzilla Minus One</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Movies/Godzilla.jpg" alt="Godzilla Minus One" class="favorite-image">
            <p>Directed by Takashi Yamazaki, stands out as one of the greatest monster films of all time due to
            its masterful blend of human drama, historical depth, and breathtaking spectacle. Set in post-World War II Japan, the film
            uses the backdrop of a nation struggling to rebuild from the ashes of war to deliver a deeply emotional and resonant story.
            Godzilla is more than a monster here—it serves as a terrifying force of nature and a potent metaphor for the atomic bomb’s
            devastation, reflecting the scars left on Japan and humanity at large. Combined with stunning visual effects, a gripping
            narrative, and a focus on the resilience of human spirit, “Godzilla Minus One” transcends its genre, becoming a profound and
            haunting exploration of survival, loss, and hope.</p>

        <section id="movie2">
            <h2>2. The Batman</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Movies/Thebatman.jpg" alt="The Batman" class="favorite-image">
            <p>Matt Reeves’ The Batman (2022) is a cinematic triumph that redefines the superhero genre through its gritty realism,
            nuanced storytelling, and a deeply layered portrayal of its iconic protagonist. Set in a grim, rain-soaked Gotham City, the
            film emphasizes Bruce Wayne’s detective skills, immersing the audience in a noir-inspired mystery as Batman unravels a web of
            corruption tied to the Riddler’s chilling crimes. Robert Pattinson delivers a brooding, vulnerable performance, capturing a
            younger Batman still grappling with his dual identity and moral complexities. With its atmospheric cinematography, haunting
            score by Michael Giacchino, and a grounded yet intense approach to action, The Batman stands out as an introspective and
            thought-provoking take on the Dark Knight, cementing itself as one of the greatest superhero films of its time.</p>

        <section id="movie3">
            <h2>3. Parasite</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Movies/Parasite.jpg" alt="Parasite" class="favorite-image">
            <p>Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite (2019) is a groundbreaking masterpiece that transcends genres to deliver a searing critique of
            class inequality with unmatched storytelling and visual artistry. The film follows the intertwining lives of the wealthy Park
            family and the impoverished Kim family, exposing the societal divisions and moral compromises that arise from their relationship.
            Seamlessly blending dark comedy, suspense, and tragedy, Parasite captivates audiences with its unpredictable twists and meticulous
            pacing. Bong’s direction, paired with striking cinematography and a richly symbolic set design, underscores the physical and 
            emotional barriers between the classes. By peeling back layers of its characters’ lives, Parasite crafts a universal tale of
            ambition, deception, and desperation, culminating in a powerful and haunting finale. Its historic Best Picture win at the Oscars
            underscores its status as one of the greatest films of modern cinema.</p>

            <h2>4. Spirited Away</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Movies/SpiritedAway.jpg" alt="Spirited Away" class="favorite-image">
            <p>Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away is a timeless masterpiece that combines breathtaking animation, imaginative world-building,
            and a deeply heartfelt coming-of-age story. The film follows Chihiro, a young girl who stumbles into a mystical realm populated
            by spirits and gods, where she must navigate a magical bathhouse to save her parents and find her way home. Miyazaki’s storytelling
            weaves themes of identity, resilience, and environmental harmony, resonating with audiences of all ages. Studio Ghibli’s hand-drawn
            animation brings the fantastical world to life with vibrant detail and mesmerizing beauty, while Joe Hisaishi’s hauntingly beautiful
            score enhances every emotional beat. Balancing whimsy with profound emotional depth, Spirited Away transcends cultural boundaries,
            becoming a landmark in animation and one of the greatest films ever made.</p>

            <h2>5. Lord of The Rings The Return of the King</h2>
            <img src="../Images/Movies/LOTR_ReturnOfTheKing.jpg" alt="Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King" class="favorite-image">
            <p>Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is an epic cinematic achievement that delivers a breathtaking
            conclusion to one of the most beloved trilogies in film history. Adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien’s monumental work, the film masterfully
            weaves together multiple storylines, from Frodo and Sam’s harrowing journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, to
            Aragorn’s rise as the rightful king of Gondor. With its sweeping battles, including the awe-inspiring Siege of Minas Tirith, and
            moments of profound emotional resonance, the film captures the timeless themes of courage, friendship, and sacrifice. Jackson’s
            visionary direction, combined with Howard Shore’s iconic score, stunning visual effects, and an unforgettable ensemble cast, elevates
            the story to unparalleled heights. Winning 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, The Return of the King remains a defining moment
            in cinematic history and a gold standard for epic fantasy storytelling.</p>
