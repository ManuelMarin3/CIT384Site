        <h1>Top 5 MMA Fighters of All Time</h1>
        <p>Here are my top 5 MMA fighters of all time, each with a description of their career and accomplishments:</p>
        
        <section id="Georges St-Pierre">
            <h2>1. Georges St-Pierre</h2>
            <p>A man who was so domminant in his career that many consider him the smartest, talented, and well rounded fighter of all time. 
            A 2 division champion with a record of 26-2 with 13 of his wins being title fights. He would avenge both his losses in very dominant fashion,
            solidifing his place in his division and showing how many levels he was above his rivals. Even after 4 years off, he came back and went up a division
            and claimed the belt off the middleweight champion in a dominant performance.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="Islam Makachev">
            <h2>2. Islam Makachev</h2>
            <p>The current pound for pound best fighter in thw world, with a record of 26-1 with the one loss coming in the first round from a fluke punch in his 
            first UFC fight. Since he has won 15 fights in a row with many of them being the best fighters in the world while also dominating almost every second
            of his fights. Defeated the at the time the #1 pound for pound and feather-weight GOAT Alexander Volkonovski 2 times in a row, one being by first round 
            finish. Also beat fighters such as Charles Olivera, Dustin Porier, Bobby Green, Dan Hooker, Drew Dober, and Arman Tsarukyan. He is currently ongoing in
            his legacy with no one in sight to be the favorite to beat him and one win away from breaking the division defense record.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="Demetrious Johnson">
            <h2>3. Demetrious Johnson</h2>
            <p>Demetrious “Mighty Mouse” Johnson is one of the most dominant and versatile fighters in MMA history, known for his unmatched skill set and creativity.
            As the inaugural UFC Flyweight Champion, he defended his title a record-breaking 11 consecutive times over nearly six years, defeating elite challengers 
            like Joseph Benavidez, Henry Cejudo, and John Dodson. His iconic suplex-to-armbar finish against Ray Borg remains one of the sport’s greatest highlights.
            After leaving the UFC, Johnson continued to excel in ONE Championship, winning the Flyweight Grand Prix and proving his greatness across organizations.
            His legacy of dominance and innovation cements him as a top GOAT contender.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="Jon Jones">
            <h2>4. Jon Jones</h2>
            <p>The youngest UFC Champion ever and is still a champion to this day. He also has the most title wins in ufc history with 16 wins, also never having
            offically lost a title fight. With a record of 28-1 with 1 no contest, without controversy considering his resume and size he should easily be considered
            the GOAT of MMA. His weakness to the case is his controversial PED history, when you look at his history with drug tests and understand what the results 
            tell you, he clearly was a PED abuser for at least half of his career, having in one title fight in particular having the testerone levels of a newborn 
            baby while fighting in the highest levels of mma looks horrible for his legacy.</p>

            <h2>5. Anderson Silva</h2>
            <p>TBA</p>
